## Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project involves analyzing the Titanic disaster dataset to gain insights and understand patterns in the data.
## Installation
Jupyter Notebook
## Dataset
The dataset used for the analysis is the Titanic disaster dataset. It contains information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic when it sank, including their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
The following steps were taken during the exploratory data analysis process:
* Univariate analysis to understand the distribution of each variable
* Bivariate analysis to understand the relationship between variables
* Feature engineering to create new variables that might be useful for modeling
## Insights
The following insights were extracted from the analysis:
Females were more likely to survive than males
Passengers in higher classes were more likely to survive than those in lower classes
Passengers who were younger were more likely to survive than those who were older
## Notebooks
The Jupyter Notebook file for the analysis is available in this repository. The notebook includes comments to enhance understanding of the analysis process.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset revealed several interesting patterns and insights about the passengers who were aboard the ship.
